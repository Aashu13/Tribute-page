                THE TIMELINE OF JACK DORSEY
                <hr>
            </h2>

            <p>
                Jack Dorsey started working as a programmer and moved to Oakland, California in 2000 in search of better career prospects.
                He started a company to dispatch taxis, couriers and emergency services using his dispatch software.</p>

            <p>During this time he also started getting serious about his idea for a short message communication service that
                would update his friends about his status in real-time.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile his company failed and Dorsey struggled for the next few years. He made his living by freelancing and
                even went to massage therapy courses. However, he never forgot his dream of creating the short message service
                he had envisioned.</p>

            <p>
                In 2009, Dorsey teamed up with fellow entrepreneur and computer science engineer Jim McKelvey to form Square Inc. Primarily
                started as a mobile payments company, Square eventually branched into financial and merchant services as
                well. The company is a fast growing one and Dorsey serves as its CEO</p>

            <p>Jack Dorsey is best known as the co-founder of online social networking service Twitter. Launched in 2006, the
                service became extremely popular within months and as of May 2015, Twitter has more than 500 million users
                and more than 25 offices around the world</p>
